# MIDI keyboard for non-mainstream scales

## Summary

Making the MIDI keyboard for playing with non-mainstream scales
![](img.png)
You probably have seen upper one.
It is the keyboard which is most popular in the world.
It was designed for playing C Major Scale Music.
But, in the world, there are a lot of Scale.
in white keys, frequently used notes in C major are assigned.
in black keys, another notes are assigned.
So, it is hard to play another Scale Music in common keyboard.

I thought that if I could make a keyboard with lots of black keys and make the black keys removable, it would be a keyboard that could be used on any scale.
## Plan

1. Make a design for this keyboard with pencil and paper.
2. Make a 3D model with CAD.
3. Make a program to output MIDI signal and switch scale with arduino.
 - using 8 segment displays, I can check what selected scale is.
